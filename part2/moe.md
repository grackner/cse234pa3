## Advantages of MoE Models

Mixture of Experts (MoE) models like DeepSeek-V3 have many advantages compared to traditional dense models:

### 1. **Scalability**:
   - MoE models can scale the number of parameters without increasing the cost of computation. This is done by activating a subset of experts instead of all the experts which reduces the cost.
### 2. **Efficiency**:
   - MoE models results in higher performance by using less FLOPs when compared to dense models. They help in reducing irrelevant computations by routing the inputs dynamically.
### 3. **Flexibility**:
   - Just by changing the value of number of experts and the mechanism for routing MoE models can adapt to any given task. This results  in wide application range.
### 4. **Adaptive Specialization**:
   - MoE models can allocate different experts to different tasks or tokens with the help of routing mechanism, this help in achieving higher performance with different applications without increasing the required cost of computation.
